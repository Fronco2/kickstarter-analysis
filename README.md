# Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

### Analysis of data on Kickstarter crowd funding to identify trends to guide on when an what types of projects are likely to succeed with funding.

### The purpose of the project is to analyze past Kickstarter data to discover what it can reveal about the feasibilty of different performance options being considered by the client.

## Analysis and Challenges
THe data was analyzed to draw out useful trends for the start of a funding project of several types. There were several possibilities being explored in both the US and Great Britan.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Launch date discovery revealed an interesting trend of sucessful campaigns twoard starting the funding in the months of February, October, and November in the US for theater, however June wsa clearly ahead of the others.
* The number of failed campaigns also rose in June but not to the degree the successful campaigns began.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
* Successful campaigns tended to have relatively modest fundraising goals and a larger number of backers suggesting perhaps a lower minimum pledge, however the minimum pledge data was not in the dataset to pursue more in depth. 
* Based on a small sample requested by the client of musicals with campaigns to run for performances in Edinburgh revealed that a goal targeting less than 4000 pounds would have the best trending results.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encounted
* The data contained a specific outlier with unclear origin skewed some of the analysis.
* Data on minimum pledge request was not available to analyze.

## Results

- Based on this data, it would be recommended to start the campaign in June.

- Having a modest funding goal to start tends to be more likely to gain full funding through Kickstarter.

- The data did not have some points could have lent more insight.

- Out of 912 campaigns for theater in the US, about 60 percent were successful or still live.  

- The data concerning live campaigns contains a number of already successful campaigns despite being ongoing.  It could be examined for any data differences compared to the ones aready considered successful in meeting the funding goals.
